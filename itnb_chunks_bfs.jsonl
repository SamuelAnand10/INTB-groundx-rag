This sharing reduces the overall number of servers and hardware components required to support computing workloads, resulting in energy savings.\n#### Reduced Waste Heat\nThe Zurich Metro Campus is developing a heating network capable of providing heat for over 3,500 households and delivering process heat to nearby businesses. This district heating initiative has the potential to replace numerous fossil-fuel-based heating systems, resulting in an annual reduction of approximately 20,000 tons of CO2 emissions.\n### IBM Linux One\nIBM LinuxONE technology significantly reduces CO₂ emissions by consolidating workloads onto a smaller number of highly efficient servers, minimizing the energy needed for compute and cooling.

It describes the service availability commitments, support response times, and remedies available to Customers. Capitalised terms not defined here have the meanings set out in the ToS or DPA. In case of conflict, the order of precedence applies: (1) Order Form/SOW, (2) DPA (for data protection), (3) SLA (for availability and support), (4) ToS.\n### 1. Scope of Services Covered\nThis SLA applies to Phoenix-provided Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings, including Phoenix-hosted AI models and the AI Concierge application. For third-party or open-source models, plugins, or integrations, Phoenix is not responsible for their availability, as set out in the ToS (Section 1.6).\n### 2. Service Availability\n2.1 Infrastructure (IaaS). Phoenix commits to a minimum Monthly Uptime Percentage of 99.99% for core infrastructure services (compute, storage, networking, GPUs), measured on a 24x7x365 basis, excluding scheduled maintenance agreed in advance.\n2.2 Platform & SaaS. Phoenix commits to a minimum Monthly Uptime Percentage of 98% for Phoenix-hosted SaaS applications (e.g., AI Concierge) and Model-as-a-Service offerings, during standard business hours (Monday–Friday, 08:00–17:00 CET, excluding Swiss public holidays). Scheduled maintenance is excluded.\n2.3 Scheduled Maintenance"}
{"id": "https://itnb.ch/en/terms/service-level-agreement#chunk-1", "url": "https://itnb.ch/en/terms/service-level-agreement", "title": "", "text": ". Phoenix will provide at least 48 hours’ notice of scheduled maintenance. Maintenance windows will, where possible, be scheduled outside of core business hours. Emergency maintenance may be conducted without notice where necessary for security or stability.\n2.4 Exclusions. Availability commitments do not apply to: (a) downtime caused by Customer misuse or unauthorised actions; (b) downtime caused by third-party applications, integrations, or providers not under Phoenix’s control; (c) beta/preview features; (d) force majeure events as defined in the ToS.\n### 3. Measurement and Reporting\nAvailability is measured monthly using Phoenix’s monitoring systems, which track service uptime at the infrastructure and application layers. Phoenix may make summary availability reports available upon request or via the customer portal.\n### 4. Support Commitments\nPhoenix provides tiered support with response times based on severity, as set out below. Resolution times are targets, not guarantees.\nSeverity Level | Definition | Initial Response Time (Plan Dependent)  \n---|---|---  \nSeverity 1 – Critical | Production service unavailable or severely degraded with no workaround. | Within 1 hour (24x7)  \nSeverity 2 – High | Significant functionality impaired; workaround available. | Within 4 business hours  \nSeverity 3 – Medium | Non-critical issue; partial degradation; workaround available. | Within 1 business day  \nSeverity 4 – Low | General questions, cosmetic issues, feature requests. | Within 2 business days  \n### 5"}

Remedies for Failure to Meet SLA\nIf Phoenix fails to meet an availability commitment under Section 2, Customer may be eligible for a Service Credit. Service Credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet SLA commitments.\n5.1 Service Credit Calculation. Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the monthly fee for the affected Service, based on the Monthly Uptime Percentage, as follows:\nMonthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit  \n---|---  \n<99.99% (IaaS only) | 5% of monthly fee for affected service  \n<98.0% (SaaS/PaaS) | 10% of monthly fee for affected service  \n<95.0% (any service) | 25% of monthly fee for affected service  \n<90.0% (any service) | 50% of monthly fee for affected service  \n5.2 Claim Procedure. To receive a Service Credit, Customer must submit a claim to support@phoenix-technologies.ch within thirty (30) days of the incident, including the dates/times of unavailability. Claims will be validated against Phoenix’s records.\n5.3 Limitations. Service Credits may not exceed 50% of the monthly fees for the affected Service. Credits are applied to future invoices and are non-refundable. SLA remedies do not apply to trial, beta, or preview Services.\n### 6. Miscellaneous\nThis SLA does not modify the disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations of liability set forth in the ToS. All capitalised terms and obligations in the ToS (including force majeure, suspension rights, and exclusions) apply equally to this SLA. Phoenix may update this SLA from time to time, with notice provided to Customers via the portal or email.\n### 7"}

Support Plans and Response Times\nPhoenix offers three tiers of support services: Basic, Advanced, and Premium. These plans provide different levels of coverage, response times, and service features. Customers select a support plan in their Order Form, which governs the level of support provided.\n7.1 Support Plan Summaries\n• Basic Support: Provides essential coverage, including access to the support portal, email assistance, and response within extended business hours. Suitable for non-critical workloads or evaluation purposes.\n• Advanced Support: Adds faster response times, access via Teams, and higher priority ticket handling. Recommended for production workloads requiring timely support and periodic assistance.\n• Premium Support: Provides the highest level of responsiveness, 24x7 availability, rapid response commitments, proactive monitoring, and access to a Technical Account Manager. Designed for mission-critical enterprise deployments requiring guaranteed coverage.\n7.2 Response Time Commitments\nThe table below consolidates Phoenix’s commitments (based on internal SLA and aligned with TogetherAI-style practices).
